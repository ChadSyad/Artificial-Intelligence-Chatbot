# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life Cycle 

The project management lifecycle is a step-by-step framework of best practices used to guide a project from its beginning to its end. It provides project managers a structured way to create, execute, and finish a project. This project management process generally includes four phases which are initiating, planning, executing, and closing. The project management life cycle is illustrated and documented using a Gantt chart, which enables AITech Inc workers to adhere to the rules and occasionally hit the milestone. The tasks and duties of each member, including the project manager, are divided into many modules by the project life cycle WBS. Based on the WBS that was created, each member has a specific job to play at each point of the lifecycle.

The Project Management Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

Next, for the Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Assistant, the system's work breakdown structure (WBS) are represented as below. The technical element of the project is broken down into a number of modules using this WBS, including goal-based, knowledge-based, service-based, and response-generated-based modules :

### Scope

The creation of a work breakdown structure (WBS) allows for the mapping of all required tasks and the development of the process, with the WBS being maintained and approved.

In this Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Assistant project, we need to identify the scope of the project. Chatbots are now based on Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Businesses are researching Natural Language Processing (NLP) to be able to send accurate responses to users' inquiries. The goal is to allow users and Artificial Intelligence to communicate naturally and understand complex requests. This would mean that customer service agents would be able to focus on other tasks while the AI takes care of customers' queries.

### Risk Identification Chart For Quality, Cost and Time

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Low quality standards, poor design, materials, and craftsmanship, and insufficient product quality assurance)|1. The chatbot lacks transparency. <br><br> 2. Not understanding customer emotion and intent.  | Quantitative key performance indicators allows to evaluate the effectiveness of the chatbot and the way it's used by its target user. |Measure the chatbot’s activity volume which evaluates the number of interactions, from the time a user asks a simple question until a constructive dialogue takes place. This indicator helps answer two key questions. <br><br> Is your chatbot being used frequently? <br><br> Is the number of users increasing? <br>|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)| The project management's budget does not match the cost estimates made during the planning phase. | When there is not enough money set aside for the administration and mitigation.|Reduce and balance the project costs overall to support a low phase budget.
|Time <br> (Fallback error response or failure message, is triggered when the chatbot doesn't understand the user's question) | 1. Project not able to reach the milestone set as described in the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Bot failure and customer frustration are often brought about by not making it clear to a customer that they are interacting with a bot and not a human agent. | When the product is faulty even at closing phase. <br><br> When the problem will be encountered during the project excution and monitoring phase.| To prevent being stuck in the problem loop, ask the other team members for assistance and swap their work or job to another one.|
