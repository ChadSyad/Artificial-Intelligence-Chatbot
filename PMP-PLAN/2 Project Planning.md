### Project Management Life Cycle 

The project management lifecycle is a step-by-step framework of best practices used to guide a project from its beginning to its end. It provides project managers a structured way to create, execute, and finish a project. This project management process generally includes four phases which are initiating, planning, executing, and closing. The project management life cycle is illustrated and documented using a Gantt chart, which enables AITech Inc workers to adhere to the rules and occasionally hit the milestone. The tasks and duties of each member, including the project manager, are divided into many modules by the project life cycle WBS. Based on the WBS that was created, each member has a specific job to play at each point of the lifecycle.

The Project Management Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is shown in the Gantt Chart below:
