This phase concludes the project management procedure. The project closing phase signifies the end of the project following the delivery of the final product. There are occasions when external talent is contracted for a certain project. The project manager is also responsible for terminating these contracts and submitting the relevant paperwork.Project completion is the final stage of a project. It occurs when the project manager confirms that the client, stakeholder, or customer has accepted the project's deliverables. If the project or product will continue after the project. 

### Formally transfer all deliverables

The first step to closing out the project is to finalize and transfer the project deliverables to the client. Go through the project plan to identify all deliverables and make sure they have been fully completed and handed off.

### Confirm project completion

Next, validate that the project is finished. Before we can formally shut down a project, everyone involved must agree that it has been completed. To confirm the project's completion, collect official sign-offs from the project's stakeholders for the project's deliverables (i.e., all stakeholders must agree that you delivered on all components of the project plan). All the document have to formally signed off.

### Review all contracts and documentation	
Review all the project documentation to ensure all parties have been paid for the work and there are no outstanding invoices.

### Release resources
Declare all resources (suppliers, contractors, team members, and partners) released from the project. In order to free them up to focus on other projects, we should let them know that the project has concluded, confirm any remaining payments or commitments, and formally release them.

### Conduct a post-mortem
When a project comes to a close, one of the most helpful things to do is to do a post-mortem or evaluation of the entire thing. Now is the moment to reflect on the project's accomplishments and setbacks in order to better plan for its future. The next step is to seek input on the project from the management team by means of a survey or meeting. Your responses, taken together, will provide a fuller picture of the project's success. (If your team is using the scrum technique, a sprint retrospective is the best way to collect this data.)

### Archive documentation
Remember to take detailed notes on the project's success and areas for growth, so that this document can be used as a resource and the lessons learned can be applied to future endeavors. In addition to serving as a reference for the team in the future, thorough documentation ensures there is a record of all project-related activities, decisions, and actions should they be requested by legal, human resources, or upper management.


### Celebrate success
In the end-of-project part, the duration of the party is one day. Celebration is to boost morale by recognising the team's efforts. Usually include all the stakeholder.
