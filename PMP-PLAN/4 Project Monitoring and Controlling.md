The fourth phases of the project management process are not consecutive. The project monitoring and control phase runs concurrently with project execution, ensuring that project objectives and deliverables are achieved. Project monitoring and control seamless execution of tasks, and helps improve efficiency and productivity of the project. Monitoring allows you to control the project including completing the project on time. The process of monitoring and controlling a project permits managers to establish effective project timelines, including scope, budget, and schedule. This data can then be utilised throughout the project's lifecycle to track its progress.

#### Monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Monitoring KPIs keeps project deliverables on track and performance up to date. Project managers use data on timelines, budgets, and quality to enable better decisions, make changes to avoid problems, and capitalize on opportunities. The process of development can be supervised through analysis coding lines.

#### Monitor Change Requests
Measuring project performance data aids in determining whether the project is on track or whether adjustments are required. If the project is veering off course, a change request will be submitted and implemented to bring it back on track. For example, the training dataset may need to change if it canâ€™t meet the target performance. So the change requests need to be sent immediately to avoid delays to another process.

#### Monitor Project Scope
This stage ensures that any modifications to the project's scope are confirmed and recorded. You must update all pertinent papers, including the project scope statement and work breakdown structure. Additionally, you will need to assess any time and cost adjustments that may result from a change in approach due to a scope expansion. In this project it will be the boundaries of the ability of chatbot.

#### Identify Risks
Ideally, risk identification should occur throughout the duration of a project, so that when risks arise, you have the necessary information to make the correct decision. For example, the risk of hiring senior or junior IT chatbot engineers is analysed.

#### Maintenance
Maintaining consistent communication keeps projects on track and helps avoid costly misunderstandings. It is essential that stakeholders and team members receive all pertinent information promptly. Inform the update of the development chatbot process to them currently.
