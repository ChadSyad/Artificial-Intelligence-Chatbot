# PROJECT OVERVIEW 

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
### Project Summary
Chatbots have been gaining popularity over the years and can be seen on almost every website we visit. They are being increasingly used by businesses for customer support and are predicted to improve customer service for many industries in the coming years. 

In our current world today, many of them are facing stress, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and boredom in difficult times. Most of them are not consulting a therapist or counsellors and just keeping their problems within themselves. Hence, this project enables the users to communicate with the chatbot to identify their problems and provide a solution for it.

In our chatbot system, the data will be trained first to help the system recognize and classify the similar texts or messages. For example, the words 'good', 'best', 'better' have the same meaning. So, the chatbot had to be trained first by using the Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique and together with Deep Learning (DL) techniques to ensure it gives the correct results although the words are synonym.
