Project Summary: [Project Summary](https://github.com/yunlee123456/Artificial-Intelligence-Chatbot/blob/main/PMP-PLAN/1%20Project%20Summary.md)

In the Project Summary, briefly describe the project's objectives and team members.

Project Planning: [Project Planning](https://github.com/yunlee123456/Artificial-Intelligence-Chatbot/blob/main/PMP-PLAN/2%20Project%20Planning.md)

Planning procedures consist of developing and maintaining a functional plan to guarantee that the project meets the needs of the company. In this phase, the Gantt Chart and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) are documented.


(Because project implementation is not covered in our syllabus, we will focus on project execution and project monitoring and controlling.  (BITI 3533 Artificial Intelligence Project Management) )


Project Execution: [Project Execution](https://github.com/yunlee123456/Artificial-Intelligence-Chatbot/blob/main/PMP-PLAN/3%20Project%20Execution.md)



In the execution phase, the project deliverables, such as software requirements and Intelligent system design, are established and documented, along with the outcome, code blocks, and technical implementation.


Project Monitoring and Controlling: [Project Monitoring and Controlling](https://github.com/yunlee123456/Artificial-Intelligence-Chatbot/blob/main/PMP-PLAN/4%20Project%20Monitoring%20and%20Controlling.md)

The monitoring and controlling phase is an ongoing process that occurs throughout the duration of a project, and involves close collaboration and communication between the project team and stakeholders. The ultimate goal of this phase is to ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.


Project Closing: [Project Closing](https://github.com/yunlee123456/Artificial-Intelligence-Chatbot/blob/main/PMP-PLAN/5%20Project%20Closing.md)
